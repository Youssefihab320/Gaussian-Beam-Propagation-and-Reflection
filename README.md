# Gaussian-Beam-Propagation-and-Reflection
This project simulates the propagation of a Gaussian beam using Fourier optics in MATLAB. The simulation follows a numerical approach to model the wave's behavior as it propagates in free space, interacts with a concave mirror, and continues propagating after reflection  
# Features
‚úÖ Simulates Gaussian beam propagation using the FFT method  
‚úÖ Implements Fourier Transform-based beam propagation (FFT2 & IFFT2)  
‚úÖ Models beam reflection from a concave mirror  
‚úÖ Plots beam intensity at multiple positions  
‚úÖ Uses MATLAB/Octave for numerical computations  

# Implementation Details
-Uses FFT and IFFT for beam propagation  
-Propagates the beam for distances 0.5ùëß, z, 2z    
-Simulates wavefront transformation after reflection  
-Outputs intensity distributions and cross-sectional plots

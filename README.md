# Gaussian-Beam-Propagation-and-Reflection
This project simulates the propagation of a Gaussian beam using Fourier optics in MATLAB. The simulation follows a numerical approach to model the wave's behavior as it propagates in free space, interacts with a concave mirror, and continues propagating after reflection
